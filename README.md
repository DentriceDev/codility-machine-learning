Write a function:

```def solution (N)```

that, given an integer N, returns the smallest integer greater than N, the sum of whose digits is twice as big as the sum of digits of N.

Examples:

1. Given N= 14, the function should return 19. The sum of digits of 19 (1+9=10) is twice as big as sum of digits of 14 (1+4= 5).

2. Given N=10, the function should return 11.

3. Given N = 99, the function should return 9999.

Assume that:

â€¢ N is an integer within the range [1..500].

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
